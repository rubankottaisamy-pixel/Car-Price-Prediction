## Overview

Used car pricing is influenced by a range of factors — age, mileage, fuel type, seller type, and more. This project builds a regression model to predict the **selling price (in lakhs INR)** of a used car given its attributes, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

---

## Dataset

The dataset (`cardata.csv`) contains **301 records** of used cars with **9 features**:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Car_Name` | Name/model of the car |
| `Year` | Year of manufacture (2003–2018) |
| `Selling_Price` | Price at which the car was sold (target variable, in lakhs) |
| `Present_Price` | Current ex-showroom price of the car (in lakhs) |
| `Kms_Driven` | Total kilometers driven |
| `Fuel_Type` | Fuel type — Petrol, Diesel, or CNG |
| `Seller_Type` | Dealer or Individual |
| `Transmission` | Manual or Automatic |
| `Owner` | Number of previous owners |

### Key Stats
- **Rows:** 301 | **Columns:** 9 | **Missing values:** None
- **Selling Price range:** ₹0.1L – ₹35L
- **Fuel types:** Petrol (79%), Diesel (20%), CNG (1%)
- **Transmission:** Manual (87%), Automatic (13%)

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — distributions, correlations, and outlier detection
- **Feature Engineering** — car age derived from year, label/one-hot encoding of categorical variables
- **Multiple ML Models** — Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- **Model Evaluation** — R², MAE, RMSE comparison across models
- **Prediction Pipeline** — end-to-end pipeline for new car price predictions

```

### Predict on new data
```bash
python src/predict.py \
  --model models/car_price_model.pkl \
  --year 2015 \
  --present_price 7.5 \
  --kms_driven 45000 \
  --fuel_type Petrol \
  --seller_type Dealer \
  --transmission Manual \
  --owner 0
```

### Run Jupyter Notebooks
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```
